# Objective 

The premise of the game is to guess how much soldiers will your enemy send to an "arena", also known as a section. There are 3 sections. You have 100 soldiers, so does your enemy.
Try to win more battles than your enemy. For each battle won, You will get 10 points. First to 100 points wins. 

# How to play / Game mechanics

You can enter a range of numbers from 0 - 100

If you don't want to use all of your 100 soldiers this round. You can underdeploy and then whatever amount of soldier left in the previous round will be added next round

If you deployed all 100 soldiers in the previous round, you will get another 100 rounds. But if you underdeployed, you can use the previous round soldiers with the current soldiers and have a more combined total. Ex: You used 50 soldier in the first round, and now in the second round you will have 150 soldiers. 

100 (1st round) - 50 (how much you deployed in the first round) = 50 (soldier remaining) + 100 (soldiers added due to it being the second round) = 150 (soldiers combined from 1st round and 2nd round)

Try not to overdeploy. Because if you do, you will lose points (a lot).
